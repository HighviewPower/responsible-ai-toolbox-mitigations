# Project

This repo consists of a python library that aims to help users including data scientists debug and mitigate errors in their data so that they can build more fair and unbiased models starting from the data cleaning stage.

There are two main functions of this library: Data Balance Analysis and Error Mitigation

The goal of Data Balance Analysis to provide metrics that help to determine how balanced the data that is being trained on is.

# Notebook Examples
