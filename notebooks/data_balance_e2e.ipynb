    "### Error Analysis on Baseline Model\n",
    "Now that we have a baseline model to work with, we can see how this model is doing overall on the data and see if there are any cohorts within the data that it performs worse on. We use the [Error Analysis Dashboard](https://erroranalysis.ai/) to determine which cohorts of data this model performs worse on. Since the error analysis dashboard is interactive and too large to render on Github, we will include screenshots from our analysis. From these screenshots we can see that if we zoom in on certain cohorts that the model is getting more errors on, that region, department and education are all attributes that are involved in those cohorts. For the purpose of this example, we chose remove some of the other columns like KPIs_met from the error analysis since we want to focus on attributes that may lead to biases rather than more measurable attributes. We will focus on analyzing and mitigating errors within the department and education columns for the rest of the analysis. "

For example the first row here indicates if people with the \"Masters & above\" education has a different proportion of people receiving the promoted outcome than those that have a Bachelor's. Lower values of these measures indicates that the amounts of people with class A vs versus those with class B with a label of 1 is similar.
