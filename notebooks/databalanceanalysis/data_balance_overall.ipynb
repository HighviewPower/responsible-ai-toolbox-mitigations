    "## Context\n",
    "Data Balance Analysis is relevant for overall understanding of datasets, but it becomes essential when thinking about building Machine Learning models in a responsible way, especially in term of fairness. It is all too easy to build an ML Model that produced biased results for subsets of the population by training or testing the model of biased ground truth data. There are multiple case studies of biased models assisting in granting loans healthcare, recruitment opportunities and many other decision making tasks. In most of these examples, the data from which these models are trained was the common issue. These findings emphasize how important it is for model creators and auditors to analysis data balance: to measure training data across various sub-populations and ensure the data has good coverage and a balanced representation of labels across sensitive categories adn category combinations and to check that test data is representative of the target population\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Data Balance Analysis when used a step for building ML models has the following benefits: \n",
    "- reduces the risk of unbalanced models, ensuring service fairness and reducing the costs of ML building by identifying data representation gaps early on and prompting data scientists to seek mitigation steps before proceeding on the training portion of Machine Learning model development\n",
    "- Enables easy end-to-end debugging of ML systems in combination with Fairlearn by providing a clear view if an issue in a model is tied to the data or the model itself."

This measure depends on the degree of society aversion to inequality (a theoretical parameter decided by the researcher), where a higher value entails greater social utility or willingness by individuals to accept smaller incomes in exchange for a more equal distribution. An important feature of the Atkinson index is that it can be decomposed into within-group and between-group inequality. | Range [0, 1]. 0 if perfect equality. 1 means maximum inequality.

Removing the instances of the majority class of each pair increases the space between the two classes, facilitating the classification process. A similar way to under-sample majority class is using Near-Miss. It first calculates the distance between all the points in the larger class with the points in the smaller class. When two points belonging to different classes are very close to each other in the distribution, this algorithm eliminates the datapoint of the larger class thereby trying to balance the distribution.\n",
